# Parking Management Application

## Purpose

Our team's project focuses on developing a Parking Management Application for a technical university. This application is designed to facilitate quick and efficient parking for students and to simplify parking lot management for security staff. The goal is to enhance the overall parking experience and streamline the management process within the university campus.

## Project Description

The project was developed based on a survey of students regarding parking issues within the university campus. Throughout the development process, I served as the team leader, responsible for ideation, project planning, designing PowerPoint presentations for reports, and creating the demo application using Figma. Other team members contributed ideas, content, and assisted with the design and development of the product.

### Key Features

- **Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR):** This technology will be used to scan vehicle license plates, enhancing security and speeding up the parking process.
- **Facial Recognition Technology:** Used to identify vehicle owners, further improving security and reducing payment processing time.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Designed to provide an intuitive experience for both students and security staff.

### Unique Aspects

One notable aspect of this project is that our research indicated a strong need among students for an application to address parking issues on campus. Furthermore, our study revealed that there are currently no existing applications available on the market for motorcycle parking management, highlighting the gap that our project aims to fill.

## Technology Stack

- **ANPR Technology:** For automatic vehicle license plate recognition.
- **Facial Recognition:** For identifying vehicle owners.
- **Frontend:** Designed using Figma.
- **Backend:** Details will be provided based on the chosen technology stack for development.

## Development Timeline

- **Duration:** Approximately 3 months
